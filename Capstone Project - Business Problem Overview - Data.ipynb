    "Understanding that Los Angeles county ranks #1 for largest county population in the US (~10 Million - larger than US 41 states), the goal of this study is to use statisical analysis and machine learning techiques on this dataset to classify cities within LA County into groups of clusters that help indentify population averages, benchmarks and indicators of success for each group - based on a variety of socioeconomic factors (i.e., income, school enrollment, life expectancy, etc.). This will be helpful for city planning and future research purposes by building off the initial research (www.measureofamerica.org/los-angeles-county/). This framework will also be useful for inserting other Los Angeles datasets for classification purposes.\n",

    "Leveraging data made available by the County of Los Angeles at (www.data.lacounty.gov/), we will be using 'A Portrait of Los Angeles County using the Human Development Index: GIS Data' at (www.data.lacounty.gov/Community/A-Portrait-of-Los-Angeles-County-using-the-Human-D/j7aj-mn8v).

    "Once the cities have been grouped into clusters, we will be grabbing population locations for each city and grouping the location data by cluster for further analysis."
