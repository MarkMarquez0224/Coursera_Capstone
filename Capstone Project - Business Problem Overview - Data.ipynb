    "With the national debt being at an all-time high for the US, becoming more efficent at managing funds at the local-level could be a great opportunity to also maximize spending at a federal level (and nationwide). So this study is going to explore a dataset of various cities within a specific area that includes various socioeconomic factors, by grouping them into different groups and creating different benchmarks for each group. By using unsupervised machine learning models that help us cluster cities into groups, this would hopefully help us provide us with enough data to make informed decisions on how to use supervised machine learning techiques to create potential benchmarks and (logisical) models that cities can use to measure the effectiveness of current resources and predict future success. Once the data has been group accordingly, then we are going to grabbing location data from popular areas in each city to see if there is an indirect relationship that we can identify (for future studies)."

    "Understanding that Los Angeles county ranks #1 for largest county population in the US (~10 Million - larger than US 41 states), the goal of this study is to use statisical analysis and machine learning techiques on this dataset to classify cities within LA County into groups of clusters that help indentify population averages, benchmarks and indicators of success for each group - based on a variety of socioeconomic factors (i.e., income, school enrollment, life expectancy, etc.). This will be helpful for city planning and future research purposes by building off the initial research (www.measureofamerica.org/los-angeles-county/). This framework will also be useful for inserting other Los Angeles datasets for classification purposes.\n",
